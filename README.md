# hello-world

1st attempt at understanding github and eventually teaching myself how to code. 

I have attempted to learn coding in the past without being able to fully commit. With growth and emotional development and a desire to want to make this knowledge easier to learn, I want to teach it to myself and make my knowledge accessible to more women and children so that they may break into more STEM fields. I find this world and its knowledge hard to organize into my simpler terms but I am determined to find a way. I feel confident now in my ability to learn it, stay focused so that I can teach someone else. I can use any help along the way.
